# DevOps Template Repository

## Purpose

This repository serves as a template for setting up and managing DevOps pipelines and infrastructure. It provides a standardized framework to streamline development, testing, deployment, and monitoring processes, ensuring consistency and efficiency across projects.

## Components

1. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):**
    - Predefined templates for provisioning cloud resources using tools like Terraform or ARM templates.
    
2. **CI/CD Pipelines:**
    - Configurations for automated build, test, and deployment workflows using tools like GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or Azure DevOps.

3. **Monitoring and Logging:**
    - Integration with monitoring tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or Azure Monitor for observability.

4. **Containerization:**
    - Dockerfiles and Kubernetes manifests for containerized application deployment.

5. **Security and Compliance:**
    - Scripts and configurations for vulnerability scanning, secret management, and compliance checks.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-org/devops-template.git
    cd devops-template
    ```

2. **Configure Environment Variables:**
    - Update the `.env.example` file with your environment-specific values and rename it to `.env`.

3. **Provision Infrastructure:**
    - Run the provided IaC scripts to set up the required cloud resources:
      ```bash
      terraform init
      terraform apply
      ```

4. **Set Up CI/CD Pipelines:**
    - Import the pipeline configuration into your CI/CD tool and update any necessary variables.

5. **Deploy the Application:**
    - Use the deployment scripts or pipeline to deploy your application to the target environment.

## Usage Examples

- **Triggering a Build:**
  Push changes to the repository to automatically trigger the CI/CD pipeline.

- **Monitoring Application Health:**
  Access the monitoring dashboard at `<monitoring-url>` to view metrics and logs.

- **Scaling Infrastructure:**
  Modify the IaC templates and reapply them to scale resources as needed:
  ```bash
  terraform apply
  ```
